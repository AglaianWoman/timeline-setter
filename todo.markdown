# TimelineSetter ToDo

## Features
* zoom to fit by series

* Allow different types of media. Expand cards to fit.

* Next/Previous card buttons (figure out how to jive this with hover. Move to click instead?)
* Per-card permalinks

* scroll along with drag
* iOS swiping

* make periodic notches work in intervals < 1 year

* add to CLI to "install" all assets for a timeline in any folder

* Add a 'reset' button
